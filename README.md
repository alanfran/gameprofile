# gameprofile 
### A user profile store for games.

Originally built to store profile information for a Garry's Mod server with a currency and custom cosmetics shop. This can help you set up a central datastore on the web to serve multiple game servers and your website.

Feel free to file issues to suggest enhancements, like new data fields.
